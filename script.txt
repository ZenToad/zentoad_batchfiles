00_batch.bat
-----------------
Start out with an empty script.

We have a main.c we are going to compile.

cl src\main.c

Great.  It worked, and it is very simple.

Also, I don't like that is spits out each line while running.
And the main.obj file is added to the main director.

Let's fix the first part.
if we add 

    echo off

to the start this will only show the output.
So the REM comments will no longer be displayed.

but 'echo off' is still displayed.  Fix that too

    @echo off

add -nologo to the cl command to stop printing out
the compiler info

01_batch.bat
-----------------
Notice this puts the main.obj and main.exe in the same folder as
the batch file.  That's going to get messy real fast.

What I'd like is to put all this stuff in a folder 
called 'bin'

you might try this:

mkdir bin
cd bin

so what does that do?
well, we can't find the file.
And now run it again?  opps, we are now in a different directory...

If we run again we see a message
'A subdirectory or file bin already exists.'

Ugh...  Why is this so hard?

First let's get rid of the message.

    if not exist bin mkdir bin
